# Walmart-Sales-Forecast
Introduction - Description of Project:
Walmart is a large grocery chain with locations all across the United States. Walmart is in a competitive market, with numerous other popular grocery chains competing to get consumers’ business. Therefore, Walmart must aim to create the optimal experience for consumers to get their business. Through collecting data and analyzing patterns in the data, Walmart will gain the tools to gain business from both existing and new customers. By creating a positive experience and using data they collect in their stores to recognize patterns, Walmart can increase the amount of sales they get, making them stand out amongst all other competitors.

Our dataset contains information about the stores, the features of the stores, and the weekly sales information for 45 locations of Walmart stores. By analyzing the data in our dataset, our goal is to recognize any trends or patterns that Walmart can utilize to implement decisions that create the maximum amount of sales for their stores. We will be analyzing the different attributes in the Walmart stores using 10 different insights that offer Walmart a glimpse into their consumers’ habits. By looking at how the different attributes affect weekly sales across the different stores, Walmart can see how much consumers spend in different environments, times of year, and more. We will be using the “train” table since it has information about weekly sales, as well as the “features” and “stores" tables from our dataset. Our audience is Walmart’s marketing and pricing teams. Ultimately, our report will help Walmart maximize sales.

The insights we will look into are:
What is the total number of stores in the dataset?
What is the total weekly sales for each store?
Which store has the highest average weekly sales during holidays?
Which store has the largest size, and what is the average weekly sales of the stores?
What is the average temperature for each store? 
Identify the top 5 weeks with the highest total sales.
Which store type has the lowest total weekly sales overall?
Which department has the highest weekly sales overall?
What is the average fuel price for the top 10 stores with highest total weekly sales?
What week has the highest weekly sales for each store?

Data Loading Concept:
This is the data loading concept that we used to load our dataset. This shows the data loading for the “features” table. We repeated this step for all of the tables from our dataset.

Overall, by analyzing trends in data for this Walmart dataset, we are able to find areas of the business that Walmart can focus on in order to maximize their total sales and increase their revenue. By analyzing attributes such as top departments, periods of time with highest sales, store type, and more we have uncovered trends that may help Walmart realize the most important factors in the amount of sales they have. They can then use these findings to help guide their decisions related to marketing, discounts, and more. Ultimately, this information that we analyzed from the data will help Walmart financially grow even more.
